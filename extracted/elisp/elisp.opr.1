You will notice copyright notices various places on Elisp.  DEC has now
agreed to pay us for work on it.  Since we are getting support from
them, we do not expect anything specific in exchange from the people we
send it to.  Therefore we hereby give permission for anyone, even
commercial users, to use it and copy it as they see fit, with the
following provisions:
  - you must retain the copyright notices on any copies you make.
  - you must give credit to Charles Hedrick and/or Rutgers University
	when describing the system in documentation or publications.
	Any documentation for Elisp that is more than 30 pages long must
	include the entire content (though not necessarily in exactly
	the same form) of the acknowlegement section from ELISP.DOC.
  - if you change Elisp sufficiently that it no longer makes sense to
	consider it the same program, documentation for your program
	should state that it is based on Elisp, acknowledging Charles
	Hedrick and Rutgers University.  Any document that is more than
	30 pages long must include the entire content (though not
	necessarily in exactly the same form) of the acknowlegement
	section from ELISP.DOC, and a rough indication of how much of
	the system and documentation is your own and how much is Elisp.
We would appreciate it if you did not send copies to other people, but
refered them to Charles Hedrick

We would like to know who are users are and make sure what they get is
up to date.  However we do not absolutely prohibit redistribution, in
case there is some specific reason why it is not practical to send
someone to us.  In particular, if one of your users leaves your site, he
should feel free to take the version of the system that he is currently
using with him.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ELISP is a version of Rutgers/UCI Lisp that supports extended
addressing. Currently it will run only on Tops-20 with KL-10 model B
processors. All 2060's are model B's.  Most 2040's are, depending upon
how recently they were made.  Some 2050's are, depending upon how
recently they were made.  No 2020 will support extended addressing.

If you do not want to rebuild from source, here are the steps needed
to install it:

1) If you are running Tops-20 version 4, look at MONITOR.CHANGES.
	This contains two patches which apply to use of extended
	addressing.  They are each given in source form, and also
	as commands which you can type to DDT to install them.
	
	In order to use extended addressing, you must put in at
	least the first patch, which is a one-word patch to turn
	on extended addressing.  It does not change any code, but
	merely enables the support that is already in the monitor.

	The other patch fixes a bug that will annoy you but not
	cause serious trouble.  When this bug hits, your job will
	be frozen for 2 minutes, after which a non-fatal BUGCHK
	will be printed on the console and you will continue.
	The bug hits if you ^C out of an extended-addressing program
	and then run another program.  You can prevent it if you
	type ^C, then type RESET, and then wait a couple of seconds
	before running any other program.

	Note that INFO MEMORY will take a *very* long time when
	you are looking at an ELISP core image.  Be patient.  It
	will work eventually.  (Release 5 speeds it up to the
	expected speed.)

  If you are running monitor version 5 or later, no changes are
	needed.

  Please caution your users not to use the EXEC's SAVE command to
	save an ELISP core image, but instead to use SAVEIMAGE
	from within ELISP.

2) Define a system-wide logical device ELISP:.  It should point to
	the directories on which the following files are put.

3) Put the following files on the system.  I show my preferences as to
	where they should go, but as long as ELISP: has the right
	definition, you can put these files anywhere you like:
  SYS:
	ELISP.EXE - the basic ELISP system
	ELISP.REL - used when you want to load .REL files 
		from languages other than LISP.  Should be on
		the same directory as ELISP.EXE.  ELISP.REL
		and ELISP.EXE must always match, i.e. if you
		put up a new ELISP.EXE, always put up the new
		ELISP.REL generated at the same time.
	ELISPC.EXE - the Lisp compiler
  DOC:
	ELISP.MAN - the manual.  NB: ELISP.MAN is actually called
		ELISP.DOC on this distribution.  This is so we can build
		a new one without clobbering existing users.  Rename
		ELISP.DOC to ELISP.MAN when you move it to its final
		resting place.
 <ELISP>
	ELISP.NDX - index into ELISP.MAN, used by the HELP system.
		This must agree with ELISP.MAN (and is generated from
		it).
	HELPER.HLP - help texts for help system
	HELPER.INDEX - index into HELPER.HLP.  This must agree with
		HELPER.HLP (and is generated from it).
	EARITH.REL, EARITH.LSP - loads trig functions and random
		number functions from the Fortran library.

=======================================================================

The following notes will help you if you are trying to generate new
versions of the system.  Note that we use the following processors:
  MIDAS - an assembler from MIT.  Used because it is much faster
	than MACRO, and because it generates an .EXE file directly,
	thus bypassing LINK.  A copy of MIDAS.EXE should be
	included with this system.
  SCRIBE - a document processor.  Available from Unilogic, Inc.  It
	is also sold by DEC.
	  Unilogic, Inc.
	  605 Devonshire St.
	  Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213
	This is used to produce ELISP.DOC from ELISP.MSS.
  SITBOL - this is a version of Snobol.  It is used to produce the index
	ELISP.NDX.  It reads ELISP.DOC.  We believe it is available
	from
	  Leslie Maltz
	  Computer Center
	  Stevens Institute of Technology
	  Hoboken, NJ
	although it is also possible that DEC is selling it.

Here are the procedures to build the various components:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build a distributed ELISP.EXE.  Requires:
  compiled Midas file: BOOT.EXE
  command file: BOOT.INIT
  compiled Lisp files: FLAP.FLAP, BOOT.FLAP, LISP.FLAP, PP.FLAP,
	EDIT.FLAP, BREAK.FLAP, ERRORX.FLAP, ARRAY.FLAP, HELPER.FLAP

You should do this whenever you change BOOT.MID, BOOT.INIT,  or the .LSP
file corresponding to any of the .FLAP files shown above.

BOOT.EXE is built from BOOT.MID, as shown below.  You can use the
existing BOOT.EXE unless you have changed BOOT.MID.

The compiled Lisp files (.FLAP) are built from the corresponding .LSP
files as shown below.  You should be able to use existing .FLAP files
except where you have changed the corresponding .LSP file.

@run boot  ;run BOOT.EXE.  This first writes out a new ELISP.REL,
*(boot)	   ;and then takes commands from BOOT.INIT.  BOOT.INIT 
	   ;causes it to automatically load all the compiled Lisp code.
	   ;(BOOT) causes the loaded core image to be dumped as
	   ;ELISP.EXE.

---------
Here is how you produce BOOT.EXE, if you change BOOT.MID.  Requires:
   source: BOOT.MID

@midas	;compile the source - produces BOOT.EXE
*boot
---------
Here is how you produce the .FLAP files.  To produce x.FLAP, you start
with x.LSP, and use the Lisp compiler (ELISPC) to compile it.  E.g.
to produce LISP.FLAP you would do

@run elispc
*(compl (lisp.lsp))
*^C

The one exception to this is that FLAP.LSP requires JOSH.INIT:

@run elispc
*(dskin (josh.lsp))
*(compl (flap.lsp))
*^C

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the distributed ELISPC.EXE.  Requires:
  Lisp core image:  ELISP.EXE
  Compiled version of the compiler: COMPLR.FLAP
  List of functions that the compiler should know about: CMACS.LOD

You should do this whenever you build a new version of ELISP.EXE, 
or if you change COMPLR.LSP or CMACS.LSP.  (You should change CMACS.LSP
whenever you add a new function to Lisp that the compiler should
know about.)

ELISP.EXE comes from the process shown above.

COMPLR.FLAP comes from compiling COMPLR.LSP, as we will show below.

CMACS.LOD is produced from CMACS.LSP, as we will show below.

@run elisp
*(dskin "complr.flap")   ;this also loads CMACS.LOD
*(bootc)		 ;this writes out ELISPC.EXE

--------------

To generate COMPLR.FLAP.  Requires:
  usable Lisp system: ELISP.EXE, or preferably ELISPC.EXE
  source: COMPLR.LSP - compiler source
  declaration file: CMACS.LOD - lists all the functions the compiler
	should know about
  various macro definition files, loaded by JOSH.LSP

This should be done whenever you change COMPLR.LSP.

If you have a version of ELISPC that can be
used, it is fairly easy.  

@run elispc
*(dskin (josh.lsp))	;loads some macros used by the compiler
*(compl (complr.lsp))	;produces COMPLR.FLAP

If for some reason you can't use the existing ELISPC:

@run elisp
*(dskin "josh.lsp")
*(dskin "complr.lsp")    Or "complr.flap" if you have compiled it.
*(compl (complr.lsp))
	COMPLR.LSP, and CMACS.LSP, use Josh's macros.  This step is
	just producing a FLAP file, so the easiest approach is to
	just load his INIT file.  Of course we do not want to load
	his init file when building any production core images.
	The output of this stage is just COMPLR.FLAP.

--------
To generate a new CMACS.LOD:  This must be done whenever you add a new
function to the system, or change the arguments or type or an existing
one.

@run elisp
@(dskin "upmacs.lsp")	;reads CMACS.LSP, writes out CMACS.LOD

----------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate ELAP.LOD.  Note that LAP is currently not needed for
the distributed version.  LAP is used for loading the machine-
independent CMACS compiled code.  The compiler now produces FLAP
code by default, which is loaded by a separate FLAP loader, which
is present in the core image by default.  This step requires an
up to date ELAP.LAP.  Note: we do not currently do this at all.
We keep around only ELAP.FLAP

run elisp
(dskin "uplap.lsp")
	The purpose of ELAP.LOD was explained above.  UPLAP
	automatically reads in JOSH.INIT, and expands all the
	macros.  Thus the resulting ELAP.LOD can be used with
	a vanilla core image.  
--------
To generate ELAP.FLAP.  See the note above about the uselessness
of ELAP.

@run elispc
*(dskin "josh.lsp")
*(compl "elap.lsp")

--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are batch control files to compile the various modules:
  COMCOM.CTL - does UPMACS and compiles the compiler
  COMALL.CTL - compiles all the modules used in ELISP.EXE

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The help system needs the following files:
   DOC:ELISP.MAN
   <ELISP>ELISP.NDX - index to DOC:ELISP.MAN, produced by the
	Sitbol program ELIX.SIT.
   <ELISP>HELPER.HLP - help text for the Help system, and other
	things not in the manual.
   <ELISP>HELPER.INDEX - index to HELPER.HLP, produced by
	HELP:CREATE-INDEX-FILE in Lisp

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The file OLD.LSP contains commands to remove some readmacro definitions
that cause incompatibilities between Elisp and R/UCI Lisp.  Use these
if you prefer to allow # ` or comma to have their old meanings instead
of the new meanings defined in Elisp.
