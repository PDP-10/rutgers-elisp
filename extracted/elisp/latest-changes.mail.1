The latest version of Elisp makes the characters # ` and , not be atom
delimiters.  Because of this ASSOC/# can now be written ASSOC#.

Beware; # is a read macro and must still be "slashified" to be used as
the first character of an atom name.  Thus the editor command ## is
written /##.

We'd like to remove ASSOC-EQUAL, which is a synonym for ASSOC#.  Is
anyone using it?
